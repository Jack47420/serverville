                Well, "coulda, woulda, shoulda"!

                But you're in luck: Today is January 24, 2011.
                Bitcoin is only worth half a dollar, the blockchain is still short, 
                and you know how much its value will explode.

                Take this opportunity, build a crypto mining empire, 
                and become a multitrillionaire!

                May your GPUs stay cool and your bitcoins come quick!`,

                Seriously though, I'm curious â€” why do you trust it? 
                Why would you invest in such a unsafe business? 
        
                But hey, I'm not complaining! 
                In fact, if you're really ready to jump in, I'm all in 
                to help you build your cryto mining serverfarm. 
                And I'm pretty sure we can have you mining blocks faster
                than you can say "Satoshi Nakamoto."
                
                So yeah, I may be scratching my head over why you trust Bitcoin so much, 
                but I can't deny it's got potential.
